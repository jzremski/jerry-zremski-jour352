<p>I am a dynamic teacher, experienced journalism leader and award-winning reporter.  I am a compelling classroom instructor who was rated as an effective teacher by 96% of his students over six semesters. I serve as director of the Philip Merrill College of Journalism Local News Network, and I am a former president of the National Press Club. I am also a dogged investigator who wrote stories about possible insider trading involving a company where Rep. Chris Collins was the lead investor – 13 months before Collins' arrest on insider trading charges.</p>
